1. Get & Post Request =>

GET => 
- used to GET some responce

- Additional Data sent in query strings
(limited, string data & visible in URL)

i.e when user enter info in form all info is visible in url

*when you want some responce in return use GET
ex. google search

POST =>
- Used to POST something (for create / write / update)
i.e to send something on backends

- Data sent via request body(any type of data)
i.e when user enter info in form all info is not visible in url

*when you dont want responce in back use Post
ex. google drive file upload

-------------------------------------------------

we can get data form get request by =>
  let { user, password } = req.query;

------------------------------------------------

to get data from Post request =>

step 1. set up request route to get some responce
ex. app.post("route", callback());

step 2. Parse Post data

in post request -> all data come in req body.
to access data from request body 
1. parse data 
2. access it

* if data is in URL encoded format->

    app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));

    -> it run for all request if it is get, post, put, etc.
    -> it decodes all oncoming data

* if data is in json format ->

    app.use(express.json());

    -> it run for all request if it is get, post, put, etc.
    -> it decodes all oncoming json data
