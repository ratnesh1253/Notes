module.exports -> a object

it gives other files info about the file it is written in

i.e special object that send file data to another file.

-by default it send a object but explicitely we can chege ints valye to num and string

require() -> a function that includes external module that exist in another files 

i.e it is written in another file where we want to access other files data

ex.
const variable = require("./filename");

filename is file where module.exports is written
./ is path means same folder

here we are passing info from math.js to script.js

we can create multiple module.exports in same file
