require v/s import

require -> we can not load selectie pieces that we need
but

import -> we can selectively load only the pieces we need, which save memory

*we either use import or require.
never use both together in project

to export ->
we use "export " keyword before the variable we want to export

to import ->

syntax:

import {variable1, variable2, ...} from "fileName.extension";

*to use this create pakage.json in parent folder
*and add "type": "module" key-value pair

---------------------------------------------------
require load everything in sequence of written in file 

import load only selected things

--------------------------------------------------------

we can import pakages also
